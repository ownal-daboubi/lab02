    <p> i created a guessing me game using the Javascript 
        it asks you about your feeling and where are you from
        where do you live and i tried as much as posibble to 
        make it interactive with user.

    <p>My name is Own AL-Daboubi. I am energy engineer.
        iI worked for two years in the energy sector and
        i am onmy way to be a software developer. My main
        goal is to link the sofware develpment with the
        energy sector.So far software development is challenging
        and unpredictible. but i love it because everday you
        learn something new.
